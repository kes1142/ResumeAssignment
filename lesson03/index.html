            <h2>Graphic Designer</h2>

            <p>Specializing in branding and advertising across all platforms. </p>
            <p>I’ve always been infatuated with logos and clever design, but it wasn’t until 2020 that I decided to launch my own career in Graphic Design. I believe in creating beautiful, thoughtful projects that accomplish client’s goals and leave a lasting impression on audiences.</p>

            <h3>Type-Driven Poster</h3>
            <p>For this project only type was allowed. I designed this poster to be hung in schools to motivate kids to wash their hands for 30 seconds to stay healthy and stop the spread of germs.</p>

                  <h3>Vintage Magazine Ad Reimagined</h3>
                  <p>This is my recreation of a 1960s black and white ad for Fender Guitars. All of the text remains the same as the original, but the vibrant color scheme and modern font bring the original ad’s same message into this century. The simple layout and clean lines should stand out among the more common dark and dynamic ads featuring musicians rocking out on stage. I also gave the Fender logo a fresh update. </p>

                    <p>This book is all you need to start mixing drinks like a pro! I wrote and designed the entire book including both the front and back cover. Reminisicent of a 1950s cocktail book, but with updated elements for a modern twist.</p>

          <h2>Work Experience</h2>
          <p>Everyone knows teachers wear many hats. We’re leaders, problem-solvers, mentors, counselors, experts in our content, event planners, performers, caregivers, and perhaps least thought of DESIGNERS! Teachers spend hours of prep time creating print and digital materials for their lessons. During my time in the classroom, I fell in love with creating and design. Now, I am working on taking it from side hustle to landing a full-time Graphic Design position!</p>
