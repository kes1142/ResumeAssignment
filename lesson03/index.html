        <h2>Graphic Designer</h2>

        <p>Specializing in branding and advertising across all platforms. </p>
        <p>I’ve always been infatuated with logos and clever design, but it wasn’t until 2020 that I decided to launch my own career in Graphic Design. I believe in creating beautiful, thoughtful projects that accomplish client’s goals and leave a lasting impression on audiences.</p>

          <h3>Type-Driven Poster</h3>
          <img src="./images/SIMMONS-33.jpg" alt="red pop art style poster that says only you can stop the flu in large letters and wash your hands for 30 seconds in small letters underneath">
          <p>For this project only type was allowed. I designed this poster to be hung in schools to motivate kids to wash their hands for 30 seconds to stay healthy and stop the spread of germs.</p>

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>Everyone knows teachers wear many hats. We’re leaders, problem-solvers, mentors, counselors, experts in our content, event planners, performers, caregivers, and perhaps least thought of DESIGNERS! Teachers spend hours of prep time creating print and digital materials for their lessons. During my time in the classroom, I fell in love with creating and design. Now, I am working on taking it from side hustle to landing a full-time Graphic Design position!</p>
